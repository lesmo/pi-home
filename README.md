**My personal PiHome project on a Raspberry Pi using Balena OS.** It combines Spotify Connect, Pi Hole and The Lounge IRC projects into the same Raspberry Pi.

## Highlights

- **Bluetooth, Airplay, Spotify Connect and UPnP**: Stream audio from your favourite music services or directly from your smartphone/computer using bluetooth or UPnP.
- **Multi-room synchronous playing**: Play perfectly synchronized audio on multiple devices all over your place.
- **Extended DAC support**: Upgrade your audio quality with one of the [supported DACs](https://sound.balenalabs.io/docs/audio-interfaces/#dac-boards)

## Motivation

![concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/master/docs/images/sound.png)

There are many commercial solutions out there that provide functionality similar to balenaSound. Most of them though come with a premium price tag and are riddled with privacy concerns.

balenaSound is an open source project that allows you to build your own DIY audio streaming platform without compromises. Why spend big money on hardware that might be deemed obsolete by the vendor as they see fit? With balenaSound you are in control, bring your old speakers back to life!

This project is in active development so if you have any feature requests or issues please submit them here on GitHub. PRs are welcome, too.
